SpriteSheetPackerImporter
=========================

I made this to import files from spritesheetpacker easier and I thought I might as well upload it.

You can download spritesheetpacker here:
http://spritesheetpacker.codeplex.com/

Below is an example of how to use it. Just call getDims( string filename, string spritename ) on a file
generated by spritesheetpacker and it will return a sorted array of sprite dimensions. (sorted by frames)

SSPI.cs is the only file you need, it's included in the sample project

Example
=========================
<h4>File smb.txt:<h4>

  mario-1 = 59 0 55 55
  
  mario-2 = 0 62 48 49
  
  mario-3 = 115 0 46 52
  
  mario-4 = 49 62 47 59
  
  mario-5 = 0 0 58 61


<h4>Code:<h4>

        static void Main(String[] Args)
        {
            List<SSPI.SpriteDims> dims = SSPI.Importer.getDims( "smb.txt", "mario" );
            //dims = {{ x = 59, y = 0, w = 55, h = 55},{ x = 0, y = 62, w = 48, h = 49}...}
        }

Other Notes
=========================
SSPI.Importer.getDims( string filename, string spritename ) cost: Disk read if filename hasn't been done before and a hash call

You generally want to store the reference to the dimensions like the example instead of calling getDims because getDims will cost a hash (plus you have to send two string paramaters, generally not a good idea to be doing that multiple times per frame)

If you want to you can copy over the data into your own data types and then call SSPI.Importer.clean() to clear the hashes.
